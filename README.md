# Debounce and Throttling
Demo project to implement debounce and throttling. 
JavaScript technique to improve application performance


With debouce implementation your function is not called unless timer has not expired.
Any subsequent calls to your function are cancelled

With throttle your function is called everytime action is perforrmed by user
Subsequent function calls are queued and executed as and when timmer expiires
Hence we have disabled button in below example which avoids any further user actions
